## Retrieving an error message from scaling activities<a name="RetrievingErrors"></a>

To retrieve an error message from the description of scaling activities, use the [describe\-scaling\-activities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/describe-scaling-activities.html) command\. You have a record of scaling activities that dates back 6 weeks\. Scaling activities are ordered by start time, with the latest scaling activities listed first\. 

To see the scaling activities for a specific Auto Scaling group, use the following command\. 

```
aws autoscaling describe-scaling-activities --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg
```

The following is an example response, where `StatusCode` contains the current status of the activity and `StatusMessage` contains the error message\.

```
{
    "Activities": [
        {
            "ActivityId": "3b05dbf6-037c-b92f-133f-38275269dc0f",
            "AutoScalingGroupName": "my-asg",
            "Description": "Launching a new EC2 instance: i-003a5b3ffe1e9358e.  Status Reason: Instance failed to complete user's Lifecycle Action: Lifecycle Action with token e85eb647-4fe0-4909-b341-a6c42d8aba1f was abandoned: Lifecycle Action Completed with ABANDON Result",
            "Cause": "At 2021-01-11T00:35:52Z a user request created an AutoScalingGroup changing the desired capacity from 0 to 1.  At 2021-01-11T00:35:53Z an instance was started in response to a difference between desired and actual capacity, increasing the capacity from 0 to 1.",
            "StartTime": "2021-01-11T00:35:55.542Z",
            "EndTime": "2021-01-11T01:06:31Z",
            "StatusCode": "Cancelled",
            "StatusMessage": "Instance failed to complete user's Lifecycle Action: Lifecycle Action with token e85eb647-4fe0-4909-b341-a6c42d8aba1f was abandoned: Lifecycle Action Completed with ABANDON Result",

            "Details": "{\"Subnet ID\":\"subnet-5ea0c127\",\"Availability Zone\":\"us-west-2b\"...}",
            "AutoScalingGroupARN": "arn:aws:autoscaling:us-west-2:123456789012:autoScalingGroup:283179a2-f3ce-423d-93f6-66bb518232f7:autoScalingGroupName/my-asg"
        },
     ...
    ]
}
```

For a description of the fields in the output, see [Activity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_Activity.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling API Reference*\.

To view scaling activities for a deleted Auto Scaling group, add the `--include-deleted-groups` option to the [describe\-scaling\-activities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/describe-scaling-activities.html) command as follows\. 

```
aws autoscaling describe-scaling-activities --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg --include-deleted-groups
```

The following is an example response, with a scaling activity for a deleted group\. 

```
{
    "Activities": [
        {
            "ActivityId": "e1f5de0e-f93e-1417-34ac-092a76fba220",
            "AutoScalingGroupName": "my-asg",
            "Description": "Launching a new EC2 instance.  Status Reason: Your Spot request price of 0.001 is lower than the minimum required Spot request fulfillment price of 0.0031. Launching EC2 instance failed.",

            "StartTime": "2021-01-13T20:47:30.094Z",

            "StatusCode": "Failed",
