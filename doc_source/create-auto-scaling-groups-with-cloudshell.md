# Create Auto Scaling groups from the command line using AWS CloudShell\.<a name="create-auto-scaling-groups-with-cloudshell"></a>

In [supported AWS Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/supported-aws-regions.html), you can run AWS CLI commands using AWS CloudShell for a browser\-based, pre\-authenticated shell that launches directly from the AWS Management Console\. You can run AWS CLI commands against services using your preferred shell \(Bash, PowerShell, or Z shell\)\.

You can launch AWS CloudShell from the AWS Management Console using either one of the following two methods:
+ Choose the AWS CloudShell icon on the console navigation bar\. It's located to the right of the search box\.
+ Use the search box on the console navigation bar to search for **CloudShell** and then choose the **CloudShell** option\. 

When AWS CloudShell launches in a new browser window for the first time, a welcome panel displays and lists key features\. After you close this panel, status updates are provided while the shell configures and forwards your console credentials\. When the command prompt displays, the shell is ready for interaction\.
