# Get started with Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling<a name="get-started-with-ec2-auto-scaling"></a>

When you use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, you must use certain building blocks to get started\. This tutorial walks you through the process for setting up building blocks to create a basic infrastructure for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling\. 

Before you create an Auto Scaling group for use with your application, review your application thoroughly as it runs in the AWS Cloud\. Consider the following: 
+ How many Availability Zones the Auto Scaling group should span\.
+ What existing resources can be used, such as security groups or Amazon Machine Images \(AMIs\)\.
+ Whether you want to scale to increase or decrease capacity, or if you just want to ensure that a specific number of servers are always running\. Keep in mind that Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can do both simultaneously\.
+ What metrics have the most relevance to your application's performance\.
+ How long it takes to launch and configure a server\.

The better you understand your application, the more effective you can make your Auto Scaling architecture\.

## Walkthrough summary<a name="gs-walkthrough-summary"></a>

In this walkthrough, you:
+ Create a configuration template that defines your EC2 instances\. You can choose either the launch template or the launch configuration instructions\. Although you can use a launch configuration, we recommend a launch template so that you can use the latest features of Amazon EC2 and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling\.
+ Create an Auto Scaling group with a single instance in it\.
+ Terminate the instance and verify that the instance was removed from service and replaced\. To maintain a constant number of instances, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling detects and responds to Amazon EC2 health and reachability checks automatically\.

If you created your AWS account less than 12 months ago, and have not already exceeded the [free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) benefits for Amazon EC2, it will not cost you anything to complete this tutorial, because we help you select an instance type that is within the free tier benefits\. Otherwise, when you follow this tutorial, you incur the standard Amazon EC2 usage fees from the time that the instance launches until you delete the Auto Scaling group \(which is the final task of this tutorial\) and the instance status changes to `terminated`\. 

## Prepare for the walkthrough<a name="gs-preparing-for-walkthrough"></a>

This walkthrough assumes that you are familiar with launching EC2 instances and that you have already created a key pair and a security group\. For more information, see [Setting up with Amazon EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/get-set-up-for-amazon-ec2.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\. 

If you are new to Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling and want to get started using the service, you can use the *default* VPC for your AWS account\. The default VPC includes a default public subnet in each Availability Zone and an internet gateway that is attached to your VPC\. You can view your VPCs on the [Your VPCs page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?/#vpcs) of the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud \(Amazon VPC\) console\.

## Step 1: Create a launch template<a name="gs-create-lt"></a>

In this step, you sign in to the Amazon EC2 console with your AWS account credentials and create a launch template that specifies the type of EC2 instance that Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling creates for you\. Include information such as the ID of the Amazon Machine Image \(AMI\) to use, the instance type, the key pair, and security groups\.

**Note**  
Alternatively, you can use a launch configuration to create an Auto Scaling group instead of using a launch template\. For the launch configuration instructions, see [Create a launch configuration](#id-gs-create-lc)\.

**To create a launch template**

1. Open the [Launch templates page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/#LaunchTemplates) of the Amazon EC2 console\.

1. On the navigation bar at the top of the screen, select an AWS Region\. The launch template and Auto Scaling group that you create are tied to the Region that you specify\. 

1. Choose **Create launch template**\.

1. For **Launch template name**, enter **my\-template\-for\-auto\-scaling**\.

1. Under **Auto Scaling guidance**, select the check box\. 

1. For **Application and OS Images \(Amazon Machine Image\)**, choose a version of Amazon Linux 2 \(HVM\) from the **Quick Start** list\. The AMI serves as a basic configuration template for your instances\. 

1. For **Instance type**, choose a hardware configuration that is compatible with the AMI that you specified\.
**Note**  
If your account is less than 12 months old, you can use a `t2.micro` instance for free within certain usage limits\. For more information, see [AWS free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)\.

1. \(Optional\) For **Key pair \(login\)**, choose an existing key pair\. You use key pairs to connect to an Amazon EC2 instance with SSH\. Connecting to an instance is not included as part of this tutorial\. Therefore, you don't need to specify a key pair unless you intend to connect to your instance using SSH\. 

1. For **Network settings**, **Security groups**, choose a security group in the same VPC that you plan to use as the VPC for your Auto Scaling group\. If you don't specify a security group, your instance is automatically associated with the default security group for the VPC\.

1. You can leave **Advanced network configuration** empty\. Leaving the setting empty creates a primary network interface with IP addresses that we select for your instance based on the subnet to which the network interface is established\. If instead you choose to configure a network interface, the security group must be a part of it\.

1. Choose **Create launch template**\.

1. On the confirmation page, choose **Create Auto Scaling group**\.

If you are not currently using launch templates and prefer not to create one now, you can create a launch configuration instead\.

A launch configuration is similar to a launch template, in that it specifies the type of EC2 instance that Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling creates for you\. You create the launch configuration by including information such as the ID of the Amazon Machine Image \(AMI\) to use, the instance type, the key pair, and security groups\. 

**To create a launch configuration**

1. Open the [Launch configurations page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?#LaunchConfigurations) of the Amazon EC2 console\.

1. On the navigation bar, select an AWS Region\. The launch configuration and Auto Scaling group that you create are tied to the Region that you specify\.

1. Choose **Create launch configuration**, and then enter **my\-first\-launch\-configuration** in the **Name** field\.

1. For **Amazon machine image \(AMI\)**, choose an AMI\. To find a specific AMI, you can[ find a suitable AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/finding-an-ami.html), make note of its ID, and enter the ID as search criteria\.

   To get the ID of the Amazon Linux 2 AMI:

   1. Open the [Amazon EC2 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

   1. In the navigation pane, under **Instances**, choose **Instances**, and then choose **Launch instances**\.

   1. On the **Quick Start** tab of the **Choose an Amazon Machine Image** page, note the ID of the AMI next to **Amazon Linux 2 AMI \(HVM\)**\. Notice that this AMI is marked "Free tier eligible\."

1. For **Instance type**, select a hardware configuration for your instance\.
**Note**  
If your account is less than 12 months old, you can use a `t2.micro` instance for free within certain usage limits\. For more information, see [AWS free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)\.

1. Under **Additional configuration**, for **Advanced details**, **IP address type**, make a selection\. To provide internet connectivity to instances in a VPC, choose an option that assigns a public IP address\. If an instance is launched into a default VPC, the default is to assign a public IP address\. If you want to provide internet connectivity to your instance but aren't sure whether you have a default VPC, choose **Assign a public IP address to every instance**\.

1. For **Security groups**, choose an existing security group\. If you leave the **Create a new security group** option selected, a default SSH rule is configured for Amazon EC2 instances running Linux\. A default RDP rule is configured for Amazon EC2 instances running Windows\. 

1. For **Key pair \(login\)**, choose an option under **Key pair options** as instructed\. Connecting to an instance is not included as part of this tutorial\. Therefore, you can select **Proceed without a key pair** unless you intend to connect to your instance using SSH\.

1. Choose **Create launch configuration**\. 

1. Select the check box next to the name of your new launch configuration and choose **Actions**, **Create Auto Scaling group**\.

## Step 2: Create a single\-instance Auto Scaling group<a name="gs-create-asg"></a>

Now use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to create an Auto Scaling group and add the launch template or launch configuration to the group\. Also include information such as the VPC subnets for the instances\. 

Use the following procedure to continue where you left off after creating either a launch template or a launch configuration\. 

**To create an Auto Scaling group**

1. On the **Choose launch template or configuration** page, for **Auto Scaling group name**, enter **my\-first\-asg**\.

1. Choose **Next**\. 

   The **Choose instance launch options** page appears, allowing you to choose the VPC network settings you want the Auto Scaling group to use and giving you options for launching On\-Demand and Spot Instances \(if you chose a launch template\)\. 

1. In the **Network** section, keep **VPC** set to the default VPC for your chosen AWS Region, or select your own VPC\. The default VPC is automatically configured to provide internet connectivity to your instance\. This VPC includes a public subnet in each Availability Zone in the Region\. 

1. For **Availability Zones and subnets**, choose a subnet from each Availability Zone that you want to include\. Use subnets in multiple Availability Zones for high availability\. For more information, see [Considerations when choosing VPC subnets](asg-in-vpc.md#as-vpc-considerations)\.

1. \[Launch template only\] In the **Instance type requirements** section, use the default setting to simplify this step\. \(Do not override the launch template\.\) For this tutorial, you will launch only one On\-Demand Instance using the instance type specified in your launch template\.

1. Keep the rest of the defaults for this tutorial and choose **Skip to review**\. 
**Note**  
The initial size of the group is determined by its desired capacity\. The default value is `1` instance\. 

1. On the **Review** page, review the information for the group, and then choose **Create Auto Scaling group**\.

## Step 3: Verify your Auto Scaling group<a name="gs-verify-asg"></a>

Now that you have created an Auto Scaling group, you are ready to verify that the group has launched an EC2 instance\.

**Tip**  
In the following procedure, you look at the **Activity history** and **Instances** sections for the Auto Scaling group\. In both, the named columns should already be displayed\. To display hidden columns or change the number of rows shown, choose the gear icon on the top right corner of each section to open the preferences modal, update the settings as needed, and choose **Confirm**\.

**To verify that your Auto Scaling group has launched an EC2 instance**

1. Open the [Auto Scaling groups page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?#AutoScalingGroups) of the Amazon EC2 console\.

1. Select the check box next to the Auto Scaling group that you just created\. 

   A split pane opens up in the bottom of the **Auto Scaling groups** page\. The first tab available is the **Details** tab, showing information about the Auto Scaling group\.

1. Choose the second tab, **Activity**\. Under **Activity history**, you can view the progress of activities that are associated with the Auto Scaling group\. The **Status** column shows the current status of your instance\. While your instance is launching, the status column shows `PreInService`\. The status changes to `Successful` after the instance is launched\. You can also use the refresh button to see the current status of your instance\.

1. On the **Instance management** tab, under **Instances**, you can view the status of the instance\.

1. Verify that your instance launched successfully\. It takes a short time for an instance to launch\. 
   + The **Lifecycle** column shows the state of your instance\. Initially, your instance is in the `Pending` state\. After an instance is ready to receive traffic, its state is `InService`\.
   + The **Health status** column shows the result of the EC2 instance health check on your instance\.

## Step 4: Terminate an instance in your Auto Scaling group<a name="gs-asg-terminate-instance"></a>

Use these steps to learn more about how Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling works, specifically, how it launches new instances when necessary\. The minimum size for the Auto Scaling group that you created in this tutorial is one instance\. Therefore, if you terminate that running instance, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling must launch a new instance to replace it\.

1. Open the [Auto Scaling groups page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?#AutoScalingGroups) of the Amazon EC2 console\.

1. Select the check box next to your Auto Scaling group\. 

1. On the **Instance management** tab, under **Instances**, select the ID of the instance\.

   This takes you to the **Instances** page of the Amazon EC2 console, where you can terminate the instance\.

1. Choose **Actions**, **Instance State**, **Terminate**\. When prompted for confirmation, choose **Yes, Terminate**\.

1. On the navigation pane, under **Auto Scaling**, choosel **Auto Scaling Groups**\. Select your Auto Scaling group and choose the **Activity** tab\.

   The default cooldown for the Auto Scaling group is 300 seconds \(5 minutes\), so it takes about 5 minutes until you see the scaling activity\. In the activity history, when the scaling activity starts, you see an entry for the termination of the first instance and an entry for the launch of a new instance\. 

1. On the **Instance management** tab, the **Instances** section shows the new instance only\. 

1. On the navigation pane, under **Instances**, choose **Instances**\. This page shows both the terminated instance and the new running instance\.

## Step 5: Next steps<a name="gs-tutorial-next-steps"></a>

Go to the next step if you would like to delete the basic infrastructure for automatic scaling that you just created\. Otherwise, you can use this infrastructure as your base and try one or more of the following:
+ Learn how to connect to your Linux instance using Session Manager or SSH\. For more information, see [Connect to your Linux instance using Session Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/session-manager.html) and [Connect to your Linux instance using SSH](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.
+ Manually scale your Auto Scaling group\. For more information, see [Manual scaling](as-manual-scaling.md)\.
+ Learn how to automatically scale where there are changes in resource utilization\. If the load increases, your Auto Scaling group can scale out \(add instances\) to handle the demand\. For more information, see [Target tracking scaling policies](as-scaling-target-tracking.md)\.
+ Configure an SNS notification to notify you whenever your Auto Scaling group launches or terminates instances\. For more information, see [Monitor with Amazon SNS notifications](ec2-auto-scaling-sns-notifications.md)\.

## Step 6: Clean up<a name="gs-delete-asg"></a>

You can either delete your scaling infrastructure or delete just your Auto Scaling group and keep your launch template or launch configuration to use later\.

If you launched an instance that is not within the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/), you should terminate your instance to prevent additional charges\. When you terminate the instance, the data associated with it will also be deleted\.

**To delete your Auto Scaling group**

1. Open the [Auto Scaling groups page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?#AutoScalingGroups) of the Amazon EC2 console\.

1. Select your Auto Scaling group \(`my-first-asg`\)\.

1. Choose **Delete**\. When prompted for confirmation, choose **Delete**\.

   A loading icon in the **Name** column indicates that the Auto Scaling group is being deleted\. When the deletion has occurred, the **Desired**, **Min**, and **Max** columns show `0` instances for the Auto Scaling group\. It takes a few minutes to terminate the instance and delete the group\. Refresh the list to see the current state\. 

Skip the following procedure if you would like to keep your launch template\.

**To delete your launch template**

1. Open the [Launch templates page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/#LaunchTemplates) of the Amazon EC2 console\.

1. Select your launch template \(`my-template-for-auto-scaling`\)\.

1. Choose **Actions**, **Delete template**\. When prompted for confirmation, choose **Delete launch template**\.

Skip the following procedure if you would like to keep your launch configuration\.

**To delete your launch configuration**

1. Open the [Launch configurations page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?#LaunchConfigurations) of the Amazon EC2 console\.

1. Select your launch configuration \(`my-first-launch-configuration`\)\.

1. Choose **Actions**, **Delete launch configuration**\. When prompted for confirmation, choose **Yes, Delete**\.
