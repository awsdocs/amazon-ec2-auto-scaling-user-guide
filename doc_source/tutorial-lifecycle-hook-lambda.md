# Tutorial: Configure a lifecycle hook that invokes a Lambda function<a name="tutorial-lifecycle-hook-lambda"></a>

In this exercise, you create an Amazon EventBridge rule that includes a filter pattern that when matched, invokes an AWS Lambda function as the rule target\. We provide the filter pattern and sample function code to use\. 

If everything is configured correctly, at the end of this tutorial, the Lambda function performs a custom action when instances launch\. The custom action simply logs the event in the CloudWatch Logs log stream associated with the Lambda function\.

The Lambda function also performs a callback to let the lifecycle of the instance proceed if this action is successful, but lets the instance abandon the launch and terminate if the action fails\.

For more information about using EventBridge, see [Use EventBridge to handle Auto Scaling events](automating-ec2-auto-scaling-with-eventbridge.md)\.

## Prerequisites<a name="lambda-hello-world-tutorial-prerequisites"></a>

Before you begin this tutorial, create an Auto Scaling group, if you don't have one already\. To create an Auto Scaling group, open the [Auto Scaling groups page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?#AutoScalingGroups) of the Amazon EC2 console and choose **Create Auto Scaling group**\.

## Step 1: Create an IAM role with permissions to complete lifecycle actions<a name="lambda-create-iam-role"></a>

Before you create a Lambda function, you must first create an execution role and a permissions policy to allow Lambda to complete lifecycle hooks\.

**To create the policy**

1. Open the [Policies page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/policies) of the IAM console, and then choose **Create policy**\.

1. Choose the **JSON** tab\.

1. In the **Policy Document** box, paste the following policy document into the box, replacing the text in **italics** with your account number and the name of your Auto Scaling group\.

   ```
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "autoscaling:CompleteLifecycleAction"
         ],
         "Resource": "arn:aws:autoscaling:*:123456789012:autoScalingGroup:*:autoScalingGroupName/my-asg"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

1. Choose **Next:Tags**, and then **Next:Review**\. 

1. For **Name**, enter **LogAutoScalingEvent\-policy**\. Choose **Create policy**\.

When you finish creating the policy, you can create a role that uses it\.

**To create the role**

1. In the navigation pane on the left, choose **Roles**\.

1. Choose **Create role**\.

1. For **Select trusted entity**, choose **AWS service**\.

1. For your use case, choose **Lambda** and then choose **Next**\. 

1. Under **Add permissions**, choose the policy that you created \(**LogAutoScalingEvent\-policy**\) and the policy named **AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole**\. Then, choose **Next**\. 
**Note**  
The **AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole** policy has the permissions that the function needs to write logs to CloudWatch Logs\.

1. On the **Name, review, and create** page, for **Role name**, enter **LogAutoScalingEvent\-role** and choose **Create role**\.

## Step 2: Create a Lambda function<a name="lambda-create-hello-world-function"></a>

Create a Lambda function to serve as the target for events\. The sample Lambda function, written in Node\.js, is invoked by EventBridge when a matching event is emitted by Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling\.

**To create a Lambda function**

1. Open the [Functions page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home#/functions) on the Lambda console\.

1. Choose **Create function**, **Author from scratch**\.

1. Under **Basic information**, for **Function name**, enter **LogAutoScalingEvent**\.

1. Choose **Change default execution role**, and then for **Execution role**, choose **Use an existing role**\.

1. For **Existing role**, choose **LogAutoScalingEvent\-role**\.

1. Leave the other default values\.

1. Choose **Create function**\. You are returned to the function's code and configuration\. 

1. With your `LogAutoScalingEvent` function still open in the console, under **Function code**, in the editor, paste the following sample code into the file named index\.js\.

   ```
   var aws = require("aws-sdk");
   exports.handler = (event, context, callback) => {
       console.log('LogAutoScalingEvent');
       console.log('Received event:', JSON.stringify(event, null, 2));
       var autoscaling = new aws.AutoScaling({region: event.region});
       var eventDetail = event.detail;
       var params = {
           AutoScalingGroupName: eventDetail['AutoScalingGroupName'], /* required */
           LifecycleActionResult: 'CONTINUE', /* required */
           LifecycleHookName: eventDetail['LifecycleHookName'], /* required */
           InstanceId: eventDetail['EC2InstanceId'],
           LifecycleActionToken: eventDetail['LifecycleActionToken']
       };
       var response; 
       autoscaling.completeLifecycleAction(params, function(err, data) {
           if (err) { 
               console.log(err, err.stack); // an error occurred
               response = {
                   statusCode: 500,
                   body: JSON.stringify('ERROR'),
               };
           } else {
               console.log(data);           // successful response
               response = {
                   statusCode: 200,
                   body: JSON.stringify('SUCCESS'),
               };
           }
       });
       return response;
   };
   ```

   This code simply logs the event so that, at the end of this tutorial, you can see an event appear in the CloudWatch Logs log stream that's associated with this Lambda function\. 

1. Choose **Deploy**\. 

## Step 3: Create an EventBridge rule<a name="lambda-create-rule"></a>

Create an EventBridge rule to run your Lambda function\.

**To create a rule using the console**

1. Open the [EventBridge console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Rules**\.

1. Choose **Create rule**\.

1. For **Define rule detail**, do the following:

   1. For **Name**, enter **LogAutoScalingEvent\-rule**\.

   1. For **Event bus**, choose **default**\. When an AWS service in your account generates an event, it always goes to your account's default event bus\.

   1. For **Rule type**, choose **Rule with an event pattern**\.

   1. Choose **Next**\.

1. For **Build event pattern**, do the following:

   1. For **Event source**, choose **AWS events or EventBridge partner events**\.

   1. For **Event pattern**, do the following:

      1. For **Event source**, choose **AWS services**\.

      1. For **AWS service**, choose **Auto Scaling**\.

      1. For **Event type**, choose **Instance Launch and Terminate**\.

      1. By default, the rule matches any scale\-in or scale\-out event\. To create a rule that notifies you when there is a scale\-out event and an instance is put into a wait state due to a lifecycle hook, choose **Specific instance event\(s\)** and select **EC2 Instance\-launch Lifecycle Action**\.

      1. By default, the rule matches any Auto Scaling group in the Region\. To make the rule match a specific Auto Scaling group, choose **Specific group name\(s\)** and select one or more Auto Scaling groups\.

      1. Choose **Next**\.

1. For **Select target\(s\)**, do the following:

   1. For **Target types**, choose **AWS service**\.

   1. For **Select a target**, choose **Lambda function**\.

   1. For **Function**, choose **LogAutoScalingEvent**\.

   1. Choose **Next** twice\.

1. On the **Review and create** page, choose **Create**\.

## Step 4: Add a lifecycle hook<a name="lambda-add-lifecycle-hook"></a>

In this section, you add a lifecycle hook so that Lambda runs your function on instances at launch\.

**To add a lifecycle hook**

1. Open the [Auto Scaling groups page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?#AutoScalingGroups) of the Amazon EC2 console\.

1. Select the check box next to your Auto Scaling group\.

   A split pane opens up in the bottom part of the **Auto Scaling groups** page\. 

1. In the lower pane, on the **Instance management** tab, in **Lifecycle hooks**, choose **Create lifecycle hook**\.

1. To define a lifecycle hook, do the following:

   1. For **Lifecycle hook name**, enter **LogAutoScalingEvent\-hook**\.

   1. For **Lifecycle transition**, choose **Instance launch**\.

   1. For **Heartbeat timeout**, enter **300** for the number of seconds to wait for a callback from your Lambda function\.

   1. For **Default result**, choose **ABANDON**\. This means that the Auto Scaling group will terminate a new instance if the hook times out without receiving a callback from your Lambda function\.

   1. \(Optional\) Leave **Notification metadata** empty\. The event data that we pass to EventBridge contains all of the necessary information to invoke the Lambda function\.

1. Choose **Create**\.

## Step 5: Test and verify the event<a name="lambda-testing-hook-notifications"></a>

To test the event, update the Auto Scaling group by increasing the desired capacity of the Auto Scaling group by 1\. Your Lambda function is invoked within a few seconds after increasing the desired capacity\.

**To increase the size of the Auto Scaling group**

1. Open the [Auto Scaling groups page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?#AutoScalingGroups) of the Amazon EC2 console\.

1. Select the check box next to your Auto Scaling group to view details in a lower pane and still see the top rows of the upper pane\. 

1. In the lower pane, on the **Details** tab, choose **Group details**, **Edit**\.

1. For **Desired capacity**, increase the current value by 1\.

1. Choose **Update**\. While the instance is being launched, the **Status** column in the upper pane displays a status of *Updating capacity*\. 

After increasing the desired capacity, you can verify that your Lambda function was invoked\.

**To view the output from your Lambda function**

1. Open the [Log groups page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home#logs:) of the CloudWatch console\.

1. Select the name of the log group for your Lambda function \(`/aws/lambda/LogAutoScalingEvent`\)\.

1. Select the name of the log stream to view the data provided by the function for the lifecycle action\.

Next, you can verify that your instance has successfully launched from the description of scaling activities\.

**To view the scaling activity**

1. Return to the **Auto Scaling groups** page and select your group\.

1. On the **Activity** tab, under **Activity history**, the **Status** column shows whether your Auto Scaling group has successfully launched an instance\. 
   + If the action was successful, the scaling activity will have a status of "Successful"\.
   + If it failed, after waiting a few minutes, you will see a scaling activity with a status of "Cancelled" and a status message of "Instance failed to complete user's Lifecycle Action: Lifecycle Action with token e85eb647\-4fe0\-4909\-b341\-a6c42EXAMPLE was abandoned: Lifecycle Action Completed with ABANDON Result"\.

**To decrease the size of the Auto Scaling group**  
If you do not need the additional instance that you launched for this test, you can open the **Details** tab and decrease **Desired capacity** by 1\.

## Step 6: Next steps<a name="lambda-lifecycle-hooks-tutorial-next-steps"></a>

Now that you have completed this tutorial, you can try creating a termination lifecycle hook\. If instances in the Auto Scaling group terminate, an event is sent to EventBridge\. For information about the event that is emitted when an instance terminates, see [EC2 Instance\-terminate Lifecycle Action](ec2-auto-scaling-event-reference.md#terminate-lifecycle-action)\.

## Step 7: Clean up<a name="lambda-lifecycle-hooks-tutorial-cleanup"></a>

If you are done working with the resources that you created just for this tutorial, use the following steps to delete them\.

**To delete the lifecycle hook**

1. Open the [Auto Scaling groups page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?#AutoScalingGroups) of the Amazon EC2 console\.

1. Select the check box next to your Auto Scaling group\.

1. On the **Instance management** tab, in **Lifecycle hooks**, choose the lifecycle hook \(`LogAutoScalingEvent-hook`\)\.
