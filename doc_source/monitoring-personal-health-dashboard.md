  Hello,

  At 2020-01-11 04:00 UTC, we detected an issue with your Auto Scaling group [ARN] in
  AWS account 123456789012.

  A security group associated with this Auto Scaling group cannot be found. Each time a 
  scale out operation is performed, it will be prevented until you make a change that 
  fixes the issue.

  We recommend that you review and update your Auto Scaling group configuration to change 
  the launch template or launch configuration that depends on the unavailable security 
  group.
        
  Sincerely,
