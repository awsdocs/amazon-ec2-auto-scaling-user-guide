# Understand the attachment status of your load balancer<a name="load-balancer-status"></a>

You can use the AWS CLI to get the attachment status of your load balancer\. For more information, see the [describe\-load\-balancer\-target\-groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/describe-load-balancer-target-groups.html) and [describe\-load\-balancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/describe-load-balancers.html) documentation in the *AWS CLI Command Reference*\.

When you describe target groups using the describe\-load\-balancer\-target\-groups command or load balancers using the describe\-load\-balancers command, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling returns the attachment status of the load balancer in the `State` parameter\.

When you attach a load balancer, it enters the `Adding` state while registering the instances in the group\. After all instances in the group are registered, it enters the `Added` state\. After at least one registered instance passes the health checks, it enters the `InService` state\. When the load balancer is in the `InService` state, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can terminate and replace any instances that are reported as unhealthy\. If no registered instances pass the health checks \(for example, due to a misconfigured health check\), the load balancer doesn't enter the `InService` state\. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling doesn't terminate and replace the instances\. 

When you detach a load balancer, it enters the `Removing` state while deregistering the instances in the group\. The instances remain running after they are deregistered\. By default, connection draining \(deregistration delay\) is enabled for Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, and Gateway Load Balancers\. If connection draining is enabled, Elastic Load Balancing waits for in\-flight requests to complete or for the maximum timeout to expire \(whichever comes first\) before it deregisters the instances\.
